When designing software, I think its important to follow best practices and keep the user in mind if appropriate. Many different people may be using the software you are creating, so its also important to provide quality documentation
and include direction of how to use features if necessary. During this project I followed proper c++ best practices and documented my code well, so if the user were to look through it they would know exactly what the code accomplished.
I intend to use these practices in my future work because it makes code easily readable and modifiable if anyone wants to implement it in their own work.

When developing programs I like to create an outline with every class or structure I will need to create so it makes sense on paper. After that, I start to implement the actual code in the program and slowly watch the
software come to life. I enjoy writing code and creating software thatâ€™s useful and informative to others. Iteration was a big part of this project because there was many different ways I could have setup the scene.
I tried many different setups and textures for the items simply because of how easy OpenGL made it to switch different properties. My approach to writing code has evolved because I gained a better understanding of how to visualize OpenGL
code and see the object before implementing any code. Working with 3d vectors and lighting properties helped me to understand some of the lower-level intricacies of OpenGL and I found the project got easier to work on as I progressed.

computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge and skills because it was an unfamiliar library I had never worked with before. I have experience with c++, which made it easier while trying to understand what individual
functions accomplished and how they contributed to the final product. I definitly plan on using the skills gained in my future professional pathway because they are simply more tools at my disposal that I can use to enhance my projects
and bring the software I create to the next level.
